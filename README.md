My second block breaker game

15 Years ago I wrote my first game in Macromedia (now Adobe) Flash. It was a classic block breaker game and it set me on my path to becoming a programmer and game developer.

Now, in an effort to teach myself Unity, I will make another block breaker game. Wish me luck!
