My ~second~ third block breaker game. Unity Version: 2019.1.6f1

15 Years ago I wrote my first game in Macromedia (now Adobe) Flash. It was a classic block breaker game and it set me on my path to becoming a programmer and game developer. 

In my third year of college I wrote another block breaker game called Breakout in Python. I had completely forgotten about this, but that repo is still up, if you really want to see it (dozercodes/Breakout).

Now, in an effort to teach myself Unity, I made another block breaker game. I hope you like it!


Nice-to-haves:
* Add multiple balls
* Add different Game Over screen for if you beat all the levels
* Call out score in Game Over screens
