# GummyBreaker
My ~second~ third block breaker game. Unity Version: 2019.1.6f1

15 Years ago I wrote my first game in Macromedia (now Adobe) Flash. It was a classic block breaker game and it set me on my path to becoming a programmer and game developer. 

In my third year of college I wrote another block breaker game called Breakout in Python. I had completely forgotten about this, but that repo is still up, if you really want to see it.

Now, in an effort to teach myself Unity, I will make another block breaker game. Wish me luck!
